# SymptoScope


# Abstract

<p>
  <b>SymptoScope</b> is an easy-to-use application where users can select their symptoms from a dropdown menu. Based on these symptoms, the model predicts the disease using two available models: Naive Bayes and Random Forest. The models were trained on a dataset called 'Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning,' which was taken from Kaggle.

  <i>Note:</i> This application is <b>not</b> intended to provide treatment recommendations, but rather to help users check for possible diseases based on their symptoms. If you experience <b>severe</b> symptoms, it is recommended that you contact a qualified healthcare professional.
